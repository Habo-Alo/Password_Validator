Users can exit the application by:

Typing exit, quit, or q when prompted for password
Using Ctrl+C (gracefully handled)
Choosing not to continue after validation

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues

"Command not found" error

Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH
Try python3 instead of python


Permission denied

On Unix systems, make the file executable: chmod +x password_validator.py


Encoding issues

Ensure your terminal supports UTF-8 encoding for special characters



Error Messages

"Password does not meet the policy": One or more requirements not satisfied
"Operation cancelled by user": User pressed Ctrl+C
"Input error occurred": EOF or input stream error

📝 Customization
Modifying Requirements
To customize password requirements, modify the PasswordValidator class:
python# Change password length
self.required_length = 12  # Change from 16 to 12

# Modify special characters
self.special_characters = "!@#$%^&*"  # Reduce allowed special chars
Adding New Validation Rules
Add new methods to the PasswordValidator class:
pythondef check_no_common_words(self, password: str) -> bool:
    """Check if password contains common dictionary words"""
    common_words = ['password', 'admin', '123456']
    return not any(word in password.lower() for word in common_words)
📊 Performance

Memory Usage: Minimal (< 1MB)
CPU Usage: Very low
Startup Time: Instant
Validation Speed: Sub-millisecond per password
